package il.ac.technion.cs.sd.grades.external

/**
 * This package and class override the external library
 * which was automatically imported to the project (you can view it under
 * the 'External Libraries' directory). This is NOT good practice but
 * was required for this assignment. In the following assignments
 * we will be using a different mechanism to achieve this behavior.
 *
 * You should implement this class for testing your library implementation.
 * Make sure it enforces the timing restrictions specified in the assignment PDF.
 * Note that your implementation will be overridden by staff code.
 * IMPORTANT: 1) DO NOT in any way alter the API of this class.
 *            2) DO NOT create any files under the package defined at the top of this file.
